#About this submission

In order to follow the requirements for the submission as written, each R source code file duplicates functionality in the `read_data` and `draw_chart` functions, so that each file works as a standalone library.

In normal circumstances these functions would be refactored into a separate file and reused for each plot, with the `specific_chart` contents being the specific operations for each plot.
